# Nosql-challenge

### Instructions
The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

**Part 1**: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up <br>
**Part 2**: Update the Database <br>
The magazine editors have some requested modifications for the database before any queries or analysis can be performed for them.<br>
**Part 3**: Exploratory Analysis <br>
Eat Safe, Love has specific questions they want you to answer, which will help them find the locations they wish to visit and avoid. <br>

## Credits

To write this script, I used the starter code provided and discussed the module challenge questions with my tutor. <br> 

He helped me write a small portion of the logic to sort and group the query. I also discussed a small syntax error with my peer, who helped me correct it. <br>
